# NSF Annual Report

## Overview

Use this skill to help prepare annual NSF Research.gov report responses for a specific award or proposal. Treat the current working directory as the active project folder unless the user gives another folder.

Keep the skill generic. Store project-specific variables and annual-report facts in `nsf-report-context.md` in the active proposal folder, not in the skill files.

Always read `references/project-context-template.md` when creating or updating a project's `nsf-report-context.md` file.

Always read the active proposal folder's `nsf-report-context.md` before drafting or revising report content. If it does not exist, create it from `references/project-context-template.md` or ask the user for the missing variables before drafting.

Always read `references/researchgov-accomplishments-template.md` before drafting or revising report content. It contains reusable Research.gov prompts, field limits, and generic response structure.

Always read `references/researchgov-impact-questions.md` before drafting or revising Impact page responses. It contains the Research.gov Impact prompts and writing guidance.

Always read `references/report-intake-questionnaire.md` before asking the user for information. It contains the reusable question set for gathering all annual-report facts before drafting.

## Workflow

1. Identify the active proposal/report folder.
   - Use the current working directory by default.
   - Inspect top-level files and likely folders such as `Submitted Documents`, `Annual Reports`, `Reports`, `Research.gov`, `Products`, `Publications`, and `REU Supplement`.
   - Prefer existing proposal documents, prior report drafts, annual logs, publications, notes, and user-supplied updates over generic language.
   - Look for `nsf-report-context.md` in the active folder. Treat this as the project's durable source of variables and annual facts.
   - If `nsf-report-context.md` is absent, create one from `references/project-context-template.md` when the user wants reusable project setup.

2. Build a project context brief before writing.
   - Start with variables in `nsf-report-context.md`: award number, reporting period, project title, PI/team, approved project goals, major research threads, broader impacts, planned evaluation, and writing preferences.
   - Extract annual facts: people supported, activities completed, results, products, publications, software/data, presentations, outreach, mentoring, deviations, and next-period plans.
   - Use local proposal files and prior drafts to fill gaps, but let explicit values in `nsf-report-context.md` override inferred facts.
   - Treat missing or uncertain facts as questions for the user; do not invent accomplishments, dates, publications, trainee names, or dissemination events.

3. Interview the user before drafting.
   - Ask the consolidated intake questions needed to complete the report without `[TODO]`, `[VERIFY]`, or `[EDIT]` markers.
   - Prefer one organized questionnaire with short section headings over many scattered interruptions.
   - If the folder already answers a question, show the inferred answer and ask the user to confirm or correct it.
   - If the user answers partially, ask targeted follow-up questions until each report section can be drafted cleanly.
   - Accept "none", "not applicable", or "unknown" as explicit answers; reflect them appropriately in the final text.
   - When the user supplies durable project facts or annual facts, add or update them in `nsf-report-context.md` unless the user asks not to.
   - Only create a placeholder draft when the user explicitly asks for a draft with placeholders.

4. Draft or update the report using the template sections.
   - Keep stable project-level language consistent across years unless the user indicates agency-approved changes.
   - For annual progress sections, include only work that occurred during the reporting period.
   - Connect accomplishments to NSF intellectual merit and broader impacts when relevant.
   - Preserve Research.gov field limits by drafting concise responses and noting when a section may need trimming.
   - Make each answer as short as possible while still answering the prompt. A sentence, two short sentences, or a numbered list is acceptable.
   - Avoid overlap between answers. Put a fact in the one field where it fits best, then do not repeat it unless Research.gov specifically requires it.
   - Use simple language that remains technically rich. Simplify sentence structure, not the technical meaning.
   - Preserve central technical terms when they are the accurate object of the work, such as hybrid limit cycles, invariant sets, reachability analysis, contraction, trajectory optimization, robust motion synthesis, and contact-rich CPS.
   - Briefly explain specialized terms in plain language when useful, for example "hybrid limit cycles, meaning periodic behaviors with continuous motion and discrete contact events."
   - Do not replace precise terms with broader but inaccurate phrases. For example, do not replace "hybrid limit cycles" with "periodic robot motions" when the hybrid-system structure matters.
   - Avoid dense jargon, acronyms without expansion, and proposal-style hype. Use concrete nouns, active verbs, and technically accurate explanations of why the work matters.
   - Do not hardcode reusable project variables in the skill. Use `nsf-report-context.md` values instead.
   - Do not leave bracketed internal notes in a Research.gov-ready draft. If an answer remains unavailable, pause and ask the user rather than filling the section with placeholders.

5. Prepare user-review output.
   - Create or update a markdown draft in the active folder unless the user asks for another format.
   - Use a filename that includes the reporting year when known, such as `nsf_report_2025_2026.md`.
   - Include an internal source/evidence note only if useful, but keep the Research.gov response text clean.
   - Before final Research.gov-ready text, remove internal comments and bracketed notes.

## Evidence Standards

- Use proposal PDFs and submitted documents for approved goals and stable framing.
- Use `nsf-report-context.md` for durable project variables and annual-report facts.
- Use current-period notes, user updates, publication lists, repositories, student records, and calendars only when available or explicitly provided.
- If documents are PDFs, spreadsheets, or Word files, use the appropriate document/spreadsheet/PDF tooling to inspect them rather than guessing from filenames.
- When the user asks for a final paste-ready answer, provide clean section text and no unresolved placeholders. If facts are still missing, ask for them before finalizing.

## Common Requests

- "Use this folder to draft the annual NSF report."
- "Update my Research.gov accomplishments section for this reporting period."
- "Turn these notes into NSF annual report responses."
- "Create a progress log for the next annual report."
- "Revise the training, dissemination, and next-year plan sections."
